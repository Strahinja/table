                                      ====

* Current WIP

    [ ] Handle tty ANSI codes (test/neofetch.sh)

    [x] Fix last row in ls -lmw30 | table when last input line has only one
        column


* v0.1.1-beta

    [x] Ignore malformed UTF-8 sequences. Currently segmentation faults
        (test/who-Huw.sh with LC_ALL=sr_RS.UTF8 and cyrillic user names)

    [x] Read and display columns

    [x] Use "T" connector chars; connector selection similar to -s


* v0.1-alpha

    [x] Handle tabs - unwrap to spaces at tab stops (test/lsb_release.sh)

    [x] Better UTF-8 substring code based on screen columns
