* v0.1-alpha

    [ ] Handle tty ANSI codes (test/neofetch.sh)

    [ ] Ignore malformed UTF-8 sequences. Currently segmentation faults
        (test/who-Huw.sh with LC_ALL=sr_RS.UTF8 and cyrillic user names)

    [x] Handle tabs - unwrap to spaces at tab stops (test/lsb_release.sh)

    [x] Read and display columns

    [x] Use "T" connector chars; connector selection similar to -s?

    [x] Better UTF-8 substring code based on screen columns
